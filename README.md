# Amit Kumar Gupta

I am currently working as Project Associate-II at Bioinformatics Centre and Virology Unit, CSIR-Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), Chandigarh, India. I have recently finished doctoral training (Ph.D. thesis submitted, November 2020) as a DST-INSPIRE Fellow at CSIR-IMTECH, Chandigarh, India, under the supervision of Dr. Manoj Kumar, Principal Scientist and Head Virology Unit. I have completed a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Bioinformatics from Manipal Life Sciences Centre (MLSC), Manipal University, Karnataka, in 2012 with the distinction (First Rank). I have done graduation (B.Sc. Bioinformatics, Biotechnology, Computer science) from Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya (DAVV), Indore (M.P.), in 2009.

As a part of research work, I have completed several independent and collaborative projects successfully focusing on the development of computational web resources, machine learning prediction algorithms, HPV and carcinoma, viromics, NGS, and metagenomics.
